# Version history
- /no version number/ (2020.01.28.): Project started with only 3 bodies. Then extended with others. (2020.01.29/30.)
- v0.9(2020.02.03.): can write out calculation history into a file, and can show the history. Menubar is added for convenience.
- v0.91(2020.02.04.): small bugfixes in the writings of the calculator
- v0.92(2020.02.05.): GUI changes in terms of color, and added "Unit" for conversion mode, but it won't convert, it's just changes the unit mode, and also the changing is not implemented, i'll do it later. :) Before i forget, i also added naming of each calculation, so to distinguish from other calculations, and there is a counter for each calculation.
- v0.93(2020.02.05.): Added a few SI units to choose from, but the program doesn't convert the numbers if you switch, only just works in other unit. Also, resizing window is disabled, and the calculation history is autoscrolling to the bottom.
- v0.9.3.1(2020.02.06.): Fixed a small bug, that it would always display UTC time in the output but now it displays your computer's local time.
- v0.9.3.2 (2020.02.06.): Put error message notification when you put text into number fields(so not the name field but the others).
- v0.9.3.3 (2020.09.01): Fixed calculations at Pyramidal frustum.
