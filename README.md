# GeometricApp
An app written in C# (Windows Forms, .NET FW 4.7.2 that can calulate area, volume, etc. off the datas of the base, side, altitude, etc. of various geometrical bodies. It's still being developed :)

# TO-DO
- To add measure unit conversion modes (cm -> dm -> m)
- Connect to a database

# Version numbering
- v0.9(2020.02.03.): can write out calculation history into a file, and can show the history. Menubar is added for convenience.
- v0.91(2020.02.04.): small bugfixes in the writings of the calculator
- v0.92(2020.02.05.): GUI changes in terms of color, and added "Unit" for conversion mode, but it won't convert, it's just changes the unit mode, and also the changing is not implemented, i'll do it later. :) Before i forget, i also added naming of each calculation, so to distinguish from other calculations, and there is a counter for each calculation.
